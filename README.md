# project_data_processing
Objective:
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a robust data
preprocessing system that addresses common challenges such as missing values,
outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. By performing effective data preprocessing,
the project aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data for
machine learning.
